# The input contains n lines for 0≤n≤100, with each line describing a particular log entry. 
# A log entry has three parts: an integer m, with 1≤m≤300, designating the number of minutes 
# at which a submission was received, an uppercase letter designating the problem, and either 
# the word right or wrong. The integers will be in nondecreasing order and may contain 
# repeats. After all the log entries is a line containing just the number −1.
